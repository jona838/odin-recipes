    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage.</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion.</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed.</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste.</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>½ cup water.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
